## Architecture

The application follows a modern web application pattern with these key components:

1. **Data Layer**: 
   - `shared/schema.ts`: Defines the core data models and validation schemas
   - `server/storage.ts`: Implements the storage interface for data persistence
   - `server/live-api.ts`: Handles external API communication and data transformation

2. **Backend Services**:
   - `server/routes.ts`: Defines REST API endpoints for the client
   - `server/snapshot-service.ts`: Manages scheduled snapshots and historical data 
   - `server/csv-import.ts`: Handles importing data from CSV files

3. **Frontend Views**:
   - `client/src/pages`: Contains the main application pages
   - `client/src/components`: Reusable UI components
   - `client/src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for shared functionality
   - `client/src/utils`: Utility functions for data formatting and processing
